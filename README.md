# Customer Booking Prediction

This project is a machine learning analysis of a customer dataset from British Airways, aimed at predicting whether a customer will complete a booking.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Use customer features to predict booking completion using interpretable machine learning models and provide insights into which variables are most influential.

## 🧠 Model
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation:** Cross-validation, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- **Visualization:** Feature Importance Chart

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📁 Project Structure
- `customer_booking.csv` – Raw dataset (not included due to size/privacy)
- `booking_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow
- `summary_slide.pptx` – Business-ready summary slide with key insights
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 📌 Key Insights
- Features like **advance booking days**, **trip duration**, and **destination** were strong predictors of booking.
- The model achieved high accuracy and interpretability using Random Forest.

## 📎 Certificate & Context
This project was part of a simulation task inspired by real-world airline customer data. Completed independently as part of an internship task.
